shmem_global_exit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

shmem_global_exit - A routine that allows any PE to force termination of
an entire program.

SYNOPSIS
========

C or C++:

.. code-block:: c++
   :linenos:

   #include <mpp/shmem.h>
   void shmem_global_exit(int status);

Fortran:

.. code-block:: fortran
   :linenos:

   include 'mpp/shmem.fh'
   INTEGER STATUS
   CALL SHMEM_GLOBAL_EXIT(status)

DESCRIPTION
===========

shmem_global_exit() shmem_global_exit is a non-collective routine that
allows any one PE to force termination of an Open- SHMEM program for all
PEs, passing an exit status to the execution environment. This routine
terminates the entire program, not just the OpenSHMEM portion. When any
PE calls shmem_global_exit, it results in the immediate notification to
all PEs to terminate. shmem_global_exit flushes I/O and releases
resources in accordance with C/C++/Fortran language requirements for
normal program termination. If more than one PE calls shmem_global_exit,
then the exit status returned to the environment shall be one of the
values passed to shmem_global_exit as the status argument. There is no
return to the caller of shmem_global_exit; control is returned from the
OpenSHMEM program to the execution environment for all PEs.
