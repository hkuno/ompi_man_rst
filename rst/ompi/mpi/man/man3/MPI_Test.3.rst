MPI_Test
~~~~~~~~
:ref:`MPI_Test`  - Tests for the completion of a specific send or receive.

SYNTAX
======

C Syntax
--------

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   #include <mpi.h>
   int MPI_Test(MPI_Request *request, int *flag, MPI_Status *status)

Fortran Syntax
--------------

.. code-block:: fortran
   :linenos:

   USE MPI
   ! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'
   MPI_TEST(REQUEST, FLAG, STATUS, IERROR)
   	LOGICAL	FLAG
   	INTEGER	REQUEST, STATUS(MPI_STATUS_SIZE), IERROR

Fortran 2008 Syntax
-------------------

.. code-block:: fortran
   :linenos:

   USE mpi_f08
   MPI_Test(request, flag, status, ierror)
   	TYPE(MPI_Request), INTENT(INOUT) :: request
   	LOGICAL, INTENT(OUT) :: flag
   	TYPE(MPI_Status) :: status
   	INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror

INPUT PARAMETER
===============

* ``request``: Communication request (handle). 

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
=================

* ``flag``: True if operation completed (logical). 

* ``status``: Status object (status). 

* ``IERROR``: Fortran only: Error status (integer). 

DESCRIPTION
===========

A call to :ref:`MPI_Test`  returns flag = true if the operation identified by
request is complete. In such a case, the status object is set to contain
information on the completed operation; if the communication object was
created by a nonblocking send or receive, then it is deallocated and the
request handle is set to :ref:`MPI_REQUEST_NULL` . The call returns flag =
false, otherwise. In this case, the value of the status object is
undefined. :ref:`MPI_Test`  is a local operation.

The return status object for a receive operation carries information
that can be accessed as described in Section 3.2.5 of the MPI-1
Standard, "Return Status." The status object for a send operation
carries information that can be accessed by a call to :ref:`MPI_Test_cancelled` 
(see Section 3.8 of the MPI-1 Standard, "Probe and Cancel").

If your application does not need to examine the *status* field, you can
save resources by using the predefined constant :ref:`MPI_STATUS_IGNORE`  as a
special value for the *status* argument.

One is allowed to call :ref:`MPI_Test`  with a null or inactive *request*
argument. In such a case the operation returns with *flag* = true and
empty *status*.

The functions :ref:`MPI_Wait`  and :ref:`MPI_Test`  can be used to complete both sends
and receives.

NOTES
=====

The use of the nonblocking :ref:`MPI_Test`  call allows the user to schedule
alternative activities within a single thread of execution. An
event-driven thread scheduler can be emulated with periodic calls to
:ref:`MPI_Test` .

ERRORS
======

Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.

Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for
I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed with
:ref:`MPI_Comm_set_errhandler` , :ref:`MPI_File_set_errhandler` , or
:ref:`MPI_Win_set_errhandler`  (depending on the type of MPI handle that
generated the request); the predefined error handler :ref:`MPI_ERRORS_RETURN` 
may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not
guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.

Note that per MPI-1 section 3.2.5, MPI errors on requests passed to
:ref:`MPI_TEST`  do not set the status.:ref:`MPI_ERROR`  field in the returned status.
The error code is passed to the back-end error handler and may be passed
back to the caller through the return value of :ref:`MPI_TEST`  if the back-end
error handler returns it. The pre-defined MPI error handler
:ref:`MPI_ERRORS_RETURN`  exhibits this behavior, for example.
