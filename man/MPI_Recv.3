.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This basic receive operation, \fI\%MPI_Recv\fP, is blocking: it returns only
after the receive buffer contains the newly received message. A receive
can complete before the matching send has completed (of course, it can
complete only after the matching send has started).
.sp
The blocking semantics of this call are described in Section 3.4 of the
MPI\-1 Standard, "Communication Modes."
.sp
The receive buffer contains a number (defined by the value of \fIcount\fP)
of consecutive elements. The first element in the set of elements is
located at \fIaddress_buf\fP\&. The type of each of these elements is
specified by \fIdatatype\fP\&.
.sp
The length of the received message must be less than or equal to the
length of the receive buffer. An MPI_ERR_TRUNCATE is returned upon the
overflow condition.
.sp
If a message that is shorter than the length of the receive buffer
arrives, then only those locations corresponding to the (shorter)
received message are modified.
.SH NOTES
.sp
The \fIcount\fP argument indicates the maximum number of entries of type
\fIdatatype\fP that can be received in a message. Once a message is
received, use the MPI_Get_count function to determine the actual number
of entries within that message.
.sp
To receive messages of unknown length, use the MPI_Probe function. (For
more information about MPI_Probe and MPI_Cancel, see their respective
man pages; also, see Section 3.8 of the MPI\-1 Standard, "Probe and
Cancel.")
.sp
A message can be received by a receive operation only if it is addressed
to the receiving process, and if its source, tag, and communicator
(comm) values match the source, tag, and comm values specified by the
receive operation. The receive operation may specify a wildcard value
for source and/or tag, indicating that any source and/or tag are
acceptable. The wildcard value for source is source = MPI_ANY_SOURCE.
The wildcard value for tag is tag = MPI_ANY_TAG. There is no wildcard
value for comm. The scope of these wildcards is limited to the proceses
in the group of the specified communicator.
.sp
The message tag is specified by the tag argument of the receive
operation.
.sp
The argument source, if different from MPI_ANY_SOURCE, is specified as a
rank within the process group associated with that same communicator
(remote process group, for intercommunicators). Thus, the range of valid
values for the source argument is {0,...,n\-1} {MPI_ANY_SOURCE}, where n
is the number of processes in this group.
.sp
Note the asymmetry between send and receive operations: A receive
operation may accept messages from an arbitrary sender; on the other
hand, a send operation must specify a unique receiver. This matches a
"push" communication mechanism, where data transfer is effected by the
sender (rather than a "pull" mechanism, where data transfer is effected
by the receiver).
.sp
Source = destination is allowed, that is, a process can send a message
to itself. However, it is not recommended for a process to send messages
to itself using the blocking send and receive operations described
above, since this may lead to deadlock. See Section 3.5 of the MPI\-1
Standard, "Semantics of Point\-to\-Point Communication."
.sp
If your application does not need to examine the \fIstatus\fP field, you can
save resources by using the predefined constant MPI_STATUS_IGNORE as a
special value for the \fIstatus\fP argument.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.
.sp
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for
I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed with
MPI_Comm_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not
guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
