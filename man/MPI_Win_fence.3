.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fI\%MPI_Win_fence\fP synchronizes RMA calls on \fIwin\fP\&. The call is collective on
the group of \fIwin\fP\&. All RMA operations on \fIwin\fP originating at a given
process and started before the fence call will complete at that process
before the fence call returns. They will be completed at their target
before the fence call returns at the target. RMA operations on \fIwin\fP
started by a process after the fence call returns will access their
target window only after \fI\%MPI_Win_fence\fP has been called by the target
process.
.sp
The call completes an RMA access epoch if it was preceded by another
fence call and the local process issued RMA communication calls on \fIwin\fP
between these two calls. The call completes an RMA exposure epoch if it
was preceded by another fence call and the local window was the target
of RMA accesses between these two calls. The call starts an RMA access
epoch if it is followed by another fence call and by RMA communication
calls issued between these two fence calls. The call starts an exposure
epoch if it is followed by another fence call and the local window is
the target of RMA accesses between these two fence calls. Thus, the
fence call is equivalent to calls to a subset of \fIpost, start, complete,
wait\fP\&.
.sp
The \fIassert\fP argument is used to provide assertions on the context of
the call that may be used for various optimizations. A value of \fIassert\fP
^ 0 is always valid. The following assertion value is supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B MPI_MODE_NOPRECEDE
No local RMA calls have been issued before this fence. This assertion
must be provided by all or no members of the group of the window. It
may enable faster fence call by avoiding unnecessary synchronization.
.TP
.B MPI_MODE_NOSTORE
Informs that the local window was not updated by local stores or get
calls in the preceding epoch.
.TP
.B MPI_MODE_NOPUT
Informs that the local window will not be updated by any put or
accummulate calls in the ensuing epoch (until next fence call).
.TP
.B MPI_MODE_NOSUCCEED
No local RMA calls will be issued after this fence. This assertion
must be provided by all or no members of the group of the window. It
may enable faster fence call by avoiding unnecessary synchronization.
.UNINDENT
.SH NOTE
.sp
Calls to \fI\%MPI_Win_fence\fP should both precede and follow calls to put, get
or accumulate that are synchronized with fence calls.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.
.sp
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for
I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed with
MPI_Comm_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not
guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
