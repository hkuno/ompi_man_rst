Open MPI \- General information
.SH OPEN MPI
.sp
Open MPI is an open source implementation of MPI (message\-passing
interface), the industry\-standard specification for writing
message\-passing programs. Message passing is a programming model that
gives the programmer explicit control over interprocess communication.
.sp
The MPI specification was developed by the MPI Forum, a group of
software developers, computer vendors, academics, and computer\-science
researchers whose goal was to develop a standard for writing
message\-passing programs that would be efficient, flexible, and
portable.
.sp
The outcome, known as the MPI Standard, was first published in 1993; its
most recent version (MPI\-3.1) was published in June 2015. Open MPI
includes all MPI 3.1\-compliant routines.
.sp
For more information about Open MPI, see \fI\%https://www.open\-mpi.org\fP\&.
.sp
The MPI standards are available at \fI\%https://www.mpi\-forum.org\fP\&.
.SH MAN PAGE SYNTAX
.sp
Man pages for Open MPI and Open MPI I/O routines are named according to
C syntax, that is, they begin with the prefix \fBMPI_\fP, all in
uppercase, and the first letter following the \fBMPI_\fP prefix is also
uppercase. The rest of the letters in the routine are all lowercase, for
example, MPI_Comm_get_attr\&.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.sp
To fine\-tune your Open MPI environment, you can either use arguments to
the \fBmpirun\fP or \fBmpiexec\fP commands, or you can use MCA parameters.
.sp
For more information on arguments, see the \fBmpirun\fP(1) man page.
.sp
For a complete listing of MCA parameters and their descriptions, issue
the command \fBompi_info \-\-all\fP\&. This information also appears in the
FAQ on the Open MPI web site at
\fI\%https://www.open\-mpi.org/faq/?category=tuning#mca\-params\fP\&.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick) return an
error value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran
routines in the last argument. Before the value is returned, the current
MPI error handler is called. By default, this error handler aborts the
MPI job. The error handler may be changed with
MPI_Comm_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler
MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values to be returned.
Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past
an error.
.sp
For more information on Open MPI error codes, see \fBmpi.h\fP in the
\fBinclude\fP directory.
