shmem_finalize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

shmem_finalize - A collective operation that releases resources used by
the OpenSHMEM library. This only terminates the Open-SHMEM portion of a
program, not the entire program.

SYNOPSIS
========

C or C++:

.. code-block:: c++
   :linenos:

   #include <mpp/shmem.h>
   void shmem_finalize(void);

Fortran:

.. code-block:: fortran
   :linenos:

   include 'mpp/shmem.fh'
   CALL SHMEM_FINALIZE

DESCRIPTION
===========

shmem_finalize is a collective operation that ends the OpenSHMEM portion
of a program previously initialized by shmem_init and releases resources
used by the OpenSHMEM library. This collective operation requires all
PEs to participate in the call. There is an implicit global barrier in
shmem_finalize so that pending communication is completed, and no
resources can be released until all PEs have entered shmem_finalize.
shmem_finalize must be the last OpenSHMEM library call encountered in
the OpenSHMEM portion of a program. A call to shmem_finalize will
release any resources initialized by a corresponding call to shmem_init.
All processes and threads that represent the PEs will still exist after
the call to shmem_finalize returns, but they will no longer have access
to any resources that have been released.
