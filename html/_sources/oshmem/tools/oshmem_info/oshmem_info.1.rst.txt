oshmem_info - Display information about the Open MPI installation


SYNOPSIS
--------

**oshmem_info [options]**


DESCRIPTION
-----------

**oshmem_info provides detailed information about the Open MPI/SHMEM
installation. It can be useful for at least three common scenarios:

1. Checking local configuration and seeing how Open MPI/SHMEM was
installed.

2. Submitting bug reports / help requests to the Open MPI/SHMEM
community (see *https://www.open-mpi.org/community/help/*)

3. Seeing a list of installed Open MPI/SHMEM plugins and querying what
MCA parameters they support.


OPTIONS
-------

**oshmem_info accepts the following options:

*-a|--all*
   Show all configuration options and MCA parameters

*--arch*
   Show architecture Open MPI/SHMEM was compiled on

*-c|--config*
   Show configuration options

*-gmca|--gmca <param> <value>*
   Pass global MCA parameters that are applicable to all contexts.

*-h|--help*
   Shows help / usage message

*--hostname*
   Show the hostname that Open MPI/SHMEM was configured and built on

*--internal*
   Show internal MCA parameters (not meant to be modified by users)

*--level*
   Show only variables with at most this level (1-9). The default is 1
   unless --all is specified without --level in which case the default
   is 9. See the LEVEL section for more information.

*-mca|--mca <param> <value>*
   Pass context-specific MCA parameters; they are considered global if
   --gmca is not used and only one context is specified.

*--param <type> <component>*
   Show MCA parameters. The first parameter is the type of the component
   to display; the second parameter is the specific component to display
   (or the keyword "all", meaning "display all components of this
   type").

*--parsable*
   When used in conjunction with other parameters, the output is
   displayed in a machine-parsable format *--parseable* Synonym for
   --parsable

*--path <type>*
   Show paths that Open MPI/SHMEM was configured with. Accepts the
   following parameters: prefix, bindir, libdir, incdir, pkglibdir,
   sysconfdir.

*--pretty*
   When used in conjunction with other parameters, the output is
   displayed in 'prettyprint' format (default)

*--selected-only*
   Show only variables from selected components.

*-V|--version*
   Show version of Open MPI/SHMEM.

   prettyprint format.

oshmem_info --all
   Show *all* information about the Open MPI/SHMEM installation,
   including all components that can be found, the MCA parameters that
   they support, versions of Open MPI/SHMEM and the components, etc.
