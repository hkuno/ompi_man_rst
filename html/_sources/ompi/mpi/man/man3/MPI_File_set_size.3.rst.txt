MPI_File_set_size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`MPI_File_set_size` - Resizes a file (collective).

SYNTAX
======


C Syntax
--------

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   #include <mpi.h>
   int MPI_File_set_size(MPI_File fh, MPI_Offset size)

Fortran Syntax (see FORTRAN 77 NOTES)
-------------------------------------

.. code-block:: fortran
   :linenos:

   USE MPI
   ! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'
   MPI_FILE_SET_SIZE(FH, SIZE, IERROR)
   	INTEGER	FH, IERROR
   	INTEGER(KIND=MPI_OFFSET_KIND)	SIZE

Fortran 2008 Syntax
-------------------

.. code-block:: fortran
   :linenos:

   USE mpi_f08
   MPI_File_set_size(fh, size, ierror)
   	TYPE(MPI_File), INTENT(IN) :: fh
   	INTEGER(KIND=MPI_OFFSET_KIND), INTENT(IN) :: size
   	INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror

INPUT PARAMETERS
================

* ``fh``: File handle (handle). 

* ``size``: Size to truncate or expand file (integer). 

OUTPUT PARAMETER
================

* ``IERROR``: Fortran only: Error status (integer). 

DESCRIPTION
===========

:ref:`MPI_File_set_size` resizes the file associated with the file handle *fh,*
truncating UNIX files as necessary. :ref:`MPI_File_set_size` is collective; all
processes in the group must pass identical values for size.

When using :ref:`MPI_File_set_size` on a UNIX file, if *size* is larger than
the current file size, the file size becomes *size*. If *size* is
smaller than the current file size, the file is truncated at the
position defined by *size* (from the beginning of the file and measured
in bytes). Regions of the file which have been previously written are
unaffected.

:ref:`MPI_File_set_size` does not affect the individual file pointers or the
shared file pointer.

Note that the actual amount of storage space cannot be allocated by
:ref:`MPI_File_set_size`. Use :ref:`MPI_File_preallocate` to accomplish this.

It is erroneous to call this function if MPI_MODE_SEQUENTIAL mode was
specified when the file was opened.

FORTRAN 77 NOTES
================

The MPI standard prescribes portable Fortran syntax for the *SIZE*
argument only for Fortran 90. FORTRAN 77 users may use the non-portable
syntax

::

        INTEGER*MPI_OFFSET_KIND SIZE

where MPI_OFFSET_KIND is a constant defined in mpif.h and gives the
length of the declared integer in bytes.

ERRORS
======

Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.

Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. For MPI I/O function errors, the default error handler is set to
MPI_ERRORS_RETURN. The error handler may be changed with
:ref:`MPI_File_set_errhandler`; the predefined error handler
MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL may be used to make I/O errors fatal. Note that MPI
does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
